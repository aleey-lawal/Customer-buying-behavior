Customer Booking Behavior Prediction
This repository contains my work from the British Airways Data Science virtual experience. During this simulation, I acted as a member of the BA Data Science team, tackling real-world challenges that impact both airline operations and customer strategy. The project is divided into two main tasks: Airport Planning and Customer Acquisition.

The Challenges
1. Lounge Demand Forecasting (Heathrow Terminal 3)
In this task, I supported the Airport Planning team by helping them understand and predict lounge demand at one of the world's busiest airports.

The Goal: To ensure the airline provides a premium experience without overcrowding.

What I did: I worked with operational data to forecast how many passengers would likely use the lounge at specific times. This helps the airline manage staffing and resources more efficiently at Heathrow Terminal 3.

2. Predicting Customer Booking Behavior
The second task focused on customer acquisition and marketing strategy. I shifted focus to identifying which customers are most likely to book a holiday.

The Goal: To help the marketing team target the right people at the right time.

What I did: I built a predictive model to analyze customer data and identify future holiday travelers. I evaluated the model’s performance to ensure it provides high-quality leads for the airline's growth strategy.

Tech Stack & Skills
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas (Data Cleaning), Scikit-Learn (Predictive Modeling), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data Visualization).

Skills: Time Series Forecasting, Classification, Feature Engineering, and Model Evaluation.

Key Takeaways
Working on these tasks gave me a deep dive into the aviation industry. I learned how data science isn't just about writing code, but about solving actual business problems—like making sure an airport lounge isn't too crowded or helping a marketing team find their next loyal customer.
